Dreams haunted by this scene from *Anne*, Paal Helge-Haugen’s 1968 *punktroman*: a novel composed of ”points.” Translation mine.

>32
>In a cove, four men with bare backs  
>and black trousers crouch in the sand.  
>I see a white body in the water. His arms,  
>hips in green water, gliding  
>like a small fish out there.  
>The water is moved by a sudden wind.  
>Their voices near me.  

Bjarne read the original Norwegian aloud to a small room of Danes on the third floor, overlooking George Square. A milky scar traverses his right eye, verifying rumors of a stint playing Russian villains in the '70s.
